# LUX-TECH-PROJECT1
#Project Description
This project involves the use of pandas and numpy for data analysis. The primary goal is to analyze weather data to uncover patterns and derive insights. This project demonstrates key techniques and methodologies used in data analysis to process and interpret the dataset.
#Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary packages:
git clone https://github.com/MastingoJay/LUX-TECH-PROJECT1.git
cd LUX-TECH-PROJECT1
pip install -r requirements.txt
#Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:
Load the dataset.
Run data preprocessing.
Execute the analysis.
#Features
Data Loading: Reading data from a CSV file into pandas DataFrames.
Data Analysis:
Find all records where the weather was exactly clear.
Find the number of times the wind speed was exactly 4 km/hr.
Check for any NULL values present in the dataset.
Rename the column "Weather" to "Weather_Condition."
Calculate the mean visibility of the dataset.
Find the number of records where the wind speed is greater than 24 km/hr and visibility is equal to 25 km.
Calculate the mean value of each column for each weather condition.
Find all instances where the weather is clear, and the relative humidity is greater than 50, or visibility is above 40.
Find the number of weather conditions that include snow.
